The GeneNetwork database is being migrated from a relational database
to a plain text and RDF database. This repository contains code to
dump the relational database to plain text.

* Using

Drop into a development environment with

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ guix shell -m guix.scm
#+END_SRC

Describe the database connection parameters in a file /conn.scm/ file
as shown below. Take care to replace the placeholders within angle
brackets with the appropriate values.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  ((username . "<username-here>")
   (password . "<password-here>")
   (database . "<database-name-here>")
   (host . "<hostname-here>")
   (port . <port-here>))
#+END_SRC

Then, to dump the database, run

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ ./pre-inst-env guile dump.scm
#+END_SRC

The database will be dumped to ~/data/dump/. Make sure there is enough
free space! It's best to dump the database on penguin2 where disk
space and bandwidth are not significant constraints.
